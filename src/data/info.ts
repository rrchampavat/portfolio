  about: `ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of the internet. 
  I'm a chill software engineer with two years under my belt, rocking JavaScript, TypeScript, 
  ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and GitHub. 
  I love creating smooth user experiences and building robust back-end solutions. 
  Feel free to check out my work â€“ I'm all about cool projects and good vibes. 
  Let's chat and see how I can bring some coding magic to your team! ðŸš€âœ¨.
